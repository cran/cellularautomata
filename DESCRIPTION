Description: Create cellular automata from 'Wolfram' rules. Allows the creation
       of 'Wolfram' style plots, as well as of animations. Easy to create multiple
       plots, for example the output of a rule with different initial states,
       or the output of many different rules from the same state. The output
       of a cellular automaton is given as a matrix, making it easy to try to
       explore the possibility of predicting its time evolution using various
       statistical tools available in R.
